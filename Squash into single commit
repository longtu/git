Squash into single commit
If you make several related commits to your local repository prior to wanting to submit for review, you should squash those commits into a single commit. If you've followed everything above, you can perform this action by doing:
git rebase -i origin/master
This will bring up your text editor with text like:
pick 749a62a Added a file
pick ec9295b Changed some code
pick be33007 Fixed my bug in that file
Change all but the first "pick" to "squash":
pick 749a62a Added a file
squash ec9295b Changed some code
squash be33007 Fixed my bug in that file
Save the file. Another file will open in your text editor which will allow you to edit the combined commit message. Be careful to only keep one of the Change-Id lines and have it be at bottom of the message after one empty line.
